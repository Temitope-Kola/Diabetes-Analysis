# Diabetes Prediction
## by Kola Temitope, Deborah
___
## INTRODUCTION
___
Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide, and understanding what puts certain groups at higher risk is crucial for prediction, prevention and management which are the main aims of this analysis. 
In this analysis, I looked at data from over 96,000 individuals to explore how factors like age, BMI, and smoking habits are linked to diabetes.  
___

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
___

The purpose of this analysis is to get insight of which risk factor is more associsated with diabetes, exploring how each of these factors are linked to diabetes. I am interested in;
* finding out how smoking is inked to diabetes
* the relationship between body mass index, blood glucose level and diabetes
* if truly age is, in some way, linked to diabetes
___
## DATA SOURCING
___
This is a dataset gotten from [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Here's the link to the dataset [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tumpanjawat/diabetes-eda-random-forest-hp/input)
___
## SKILLLS DEMONSTRATED
___
For this project, I optimized EXCEL for data cleaning,transformation and visualization.
___
## DATA CLEANING.
___
The dataset was very dirty with missing values,duplicates and blanks. I did lots of cleaning using Excel but I'll walk through the most import parts

## DATA TRANSFORMATION

* The dataset had fewwer columns as compared to after I transformed it. I observed, to get the most out of the dataset, it was important to create more columns from the existing columns.
* I transformed the data using very complex Excel functions, combining the IF function alomgside OR.
* I was able to do this by carefully going through each column and understanding what must be done, it was very delightful to see that, the transformation I had made provided better perspective to my analysis.

* Current and former smokers have significantly higher diabetes prevalence (10-17%), compared to non-smokers and those with no history (~4%).

## CONCLUSION
___
*	Age and Diabetes:
	Diabetes prevalence increases significantly with age, particularly after 40 years, Peaking at over 20% for individuals 61 years and older.
*	BMI and Diabetes:
Obesity is strongly associated with diabetes, with nearly 18% of obese individuals affected. Maintaining a healthy BMI significantly reduces diabetes risk.
 *	Smoking and Diabetes:
Current and former smokers have significantly higher diabetes prevalence (10-17%), compared to non-smokers and those with no history (~4%).
